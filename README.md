# Movie-Recommendation-System
This is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System built using the Netflix dataset. It recommends movies or TV shows similar to a user’s favorite title. Unlike collaborative systems that rely on user ratings this recommender works purely on content similarity making it lightweight, fast, and ideal for personalization.
